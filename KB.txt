Array:
Stores data elements based on an sequential, most commonly
0 based, index.
Based on tuples from set theory.
Optimal for indexing;bad at searching, inserting and deleting.
Linear arrays, or one dimensional arrays are the most basic.
Are static in size meaning that they are declared with fixed 
size.
Dynamic arrays are like one dimensional arrays but have 
reserved space for additional elements.
If a dynamic array is full, it copies its contents to a larger
array.
N dimensional array.

Linked List:
Store data with nodes that point to other nodes.
Node is the basic element of linked list data structure.
Doubly linked list
Circularly linked list

Stack

Queues

Hash Table and Hash Map
Stores data with key values pairs.
Hash functions accept a key and return an output unique only to that
Specific key.
This is known as hashing, which is the concept that an input and an output
Have a one-to-one correspondent to map information.
Hash function return a unique address I memory for that data.

What you should know:
Designed to optimize searching, insertion and deletion.
Hash collisions are when a hash function returns the same output for
different input.
All hash function have such problem.
This is often accommodated for by having the hash tables be very large.

Hashes are important for associative arrays and database indexing.

Binary tree, what you should know:
Designed to optimize searching and sorting.
A degenerate tree is an unbalanced tree, which if entire one-sided is
Essentially a linked list.

They are comparably simple to implement than other data structure.
Used to make binary search trees.
A binary tree that uses comparable keys to assign which direction a child
is.
Left child has a key smaller than its parent node.
Right child has a key greater than its parent node.
There can be no duplicate node.
Because of the above, it is more likely to used as a data structure
than a binary tree.
Search Basics
An algorithm that searches a tree(or graph) by searching levels of the
tree, first starting at the root.
It finds every node on the same level, most often moving left or right.
While doing this it tracks the children nodes of the nodes on the current
level.
When finished examining a level it moves to the left most mode on the next
level.
The bottom-right most node most node is evaluated last
What you need to know:
Optimal for searching a tree that is wider than its deep.
Uses a queue to store information about the tree while it traverses a tree.
Because it uses a queue it is more memory intensive than DFS.
The queue uses more memory because it needs to stores nodes.
DFS:
An algorithm that searches a graph by searching depth first, starting at root.
It traverses left down a tree until it cannot go furture.
Once it reaches the end of a branch it traverses back up trying the right
of the root then go left on all nodes until bottom.
The right most node is evaluated last.
What you should know:

A static method belongs to the class rather than the object of a class.
A static method can be invoked without the need for creating an instance of a class.
A static method can access static data member and can change the value of it.






Q) Why is the Java main method static?
Ans) It is because the object is not required to call a static method. If it were a non-static method, JVM creates an object first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory allocation.

In Java, what methods can be called without an object reference?
Static method.
