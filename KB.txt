Array:
Stores data elements based on an sequential, most commonly
0 based, index.
Based on tuples from set theory.
Optimal for indexing;bad at searching, inserting and deleting.
Linear arrays, or one dimensinal arrays are the most basic.
Are static in size meaning that they are declared with fixed 
size.
Dynamic arrays are like one dimensional arrays but have 
reserved space for additional elements.
If a dynamic array is full, it copies its contents to a larger
array.
N dimensinal array.

Linked List:
Store data with nodes that point to other nodes.
